      <p>1. Speakable Me: A Gamified Learning App for DMMMSU-MLUC Kindergarten Pupils is developed following the Design
        Science Research as the software methodology. Voice Recognition is used in developing the game. The features
        included in the game are recognition of shapes, alphabets, colors, numbers and animals.</p>
      <p>2. Speakable Me: A Gamified Learning App for DMMMSU-MLUC Kindergarten Pupils is built using free-form speech
        recognition in applying voice recognition, Photoshop 2016 for the icons and pictures is integrated in the game.

      <header>Conclusions</header>
      <p>1. Utilizing the Design Science Research (DSR) as the software methodology of Speakable Me: A Gamified Learning
        App for DMMMSU-MLUC Kindergarten Pupils is proven to be applicable voice.</p>
      <p>2. Free-form speech recognition in applying voice recognition, Photoshop 2016 for the icons and pictures and
        the existing audio recorder of the mobile device is well utilized.</p>
      <p>3. The developed application is described as highly acceptable, therefore, it achieves the intended purpose and
        objective of the Speakable Me: A Gamified Learning App for DMMMSU-MLUC Kindergarten Pupils.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Recommendations">
      <header>Recommendations</header>
      <p>1. Design Science Research (DSR) methodology must be used for the development of mobile applications as it is
        proven to be applicable in the development of Speakable Me: A Gamified Learning App for DMMMSU-MLUC Kindergarten
        Pupils could be used as an additional learning material for pupilsâ€™ learning experience.</p>
      <p>2. Free-form speech recognition is an applicable framework in voice recognition techniques. Also, the existing
        audio recorder of the mobile phone can be integrated in the game application.</p>
      <p>3. Based from the grand mean of Speakable Me: A Gamified Learning App for DMMMSU-MLUC Kindergarten Pupils, the
        researchers recommended that the game application may be used as an additional material in the learning
        experience of kindergarten.</p>
      <p>4. Future researchers conducting the same or related researchers must make further improvements to enhance the
        features of the interactive learning application such as adding more subjects in the game.</p>
      <p>5. Future researchers conducting related project must add more games utilizing voice recognition techniques.
